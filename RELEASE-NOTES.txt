                    RELEASE NOTES

The Commons DbUtils team is pleased to announce the release of Commons DbUtils 2.0

The Apache Commons-DbUtils package is a set of
  Java utility classes for easing JDBC development.

Backwards incompatible update of Commons DBUtils

This is the first release of the 2.x branch of the Commons DbUtils package, DbUtils2.
The motivation for creating DbUtils2 was two-fold: a number of deprecated methods in the original DbUtils, and the desire to support named parameters (DBUTILS-105).

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o DBUTILS-105:  Added named parameter support with fluent API 

Fixed Bugs:
o DBUTILS-109:  AbstractExecutor.currentPosition should be an int
