			 Commons DbUtils Package
			   Version 1.0-RC1
			    Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This is the first release of the Commons DbUtils package.  DbUtils
is a small set of classes designed to make working with JDBC easier.  More 
information can be found at http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbutils/.

FEATURES:

* QueryRunner class with ResultSetHandler interface allow you to easily query or
update a database and handle the ResultSet.  Several useful implementations
of the ResultSetHandler interface are located in the 
org.apache.commons.dbutils.handlers.* package.

* ResultSet wrappers that decorate ResultSets with specialized behavior.  See
the classes in the org.apache.commons.dbutils.wrappers.* package for details.

* Dynamic JDBC API interface implementations via the standard 
java.lang.reflect.Proxy class.  This allows you to implement JDBC interfaces
such as ResultSet at runtime to avoid API version incompatibilities.  See 
org.apache.commons.dbutils.ProxyFactory for details.
